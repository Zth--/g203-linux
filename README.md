# g203-linux
Led control for the mouse Logitech G203

This can be extended to be a full driver for linux. I was just interested in turning off the goddamn light. 

**Line 13 holds the RGB value in hex that will be sent to the mouse, use three 0x00 to turn off.**

Feel free to contact me if you need any help with this.
